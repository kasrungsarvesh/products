This readme file provides instructions on how to run the project developed using Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 and SQL Server 2012.

Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

Microsoft Visual Studio 2015
SQL Server 2012
.NET Framework 4.5 or later
Setup Instructions
Follow the steps below to set up and run the project:

Clone the project repository to your local machine using Git or download the project as a ZIP file and extract it.
Open Microsoft Visual Studio 2015.
Navigate to File > Open > Project/Solution and browse to the location where you cloned or extracted the project. Select the project file with the extension .sln and click Open.
The project will be loaded into Visual Studio. Once loaded, you may need to restore the NuGet packages used in the project. To do this, right-click on the project in the Solution Explorer, select Manage NuGet Packages, and click on Restore. Wait for the packages to be restored.
The project may require a connection to a SQL Server database. Make sure you have SQL Server 2012 installed and running. If you don't have a database set up, you can create a new database in SQL Server Management Studio.
In Visual Studio, open the web.config file located in the project's root directory. Look for the <connectionStrings> section and update the connection string with the necessary details to connect to your SQL Server database. Save the file.
Build the project by selecting Build > Build Solution or pressing Ctrl+Shift+B. Ensure that there are no build errors.
Once the project is successfully built, you can run it by selecting Debug > Start Debugging or pressing F5. Alternatively, you can also select Debug > Start Without Debugging or press Ctrl+F5 to run the project without debugging.
The project will start running in your default web browser, and you should be able to interact with the application.
Note: If you encounter any errors during the setup process, make sure you have followed the setup instructions correctly and that your system meets all the prerequisites.

Additional Notes
If you need to modify any configuration settings, such as database connection strings or application-specific settings, you can do so in the web.config file.
If you encounter any issues or have questions about the project, please refer to the project documentation or contact the project maintainers.
